Lab assignment 01 -  Implementation and algorithm to compute the allowable range of launch angle for the rocket system.

* Implemention of an algorithm to compute the allowable range of launch angles for the first stage of the
* rocket system to reach a target maximum altitude within a specified tolerance. The launch angle from vertical as φ0 and the target maximum altitude as αR, where R is the radius of Earth (i.e. distance from Earth's centre at maximum altitude is R + αR). 
* Assumptions:
* The maximum (initial) velocity of the launch vehicle v0 is reached shortly after
* launch when the altitude is small, so the initial height is approximately R
* There is no active thrust after reaching v0 so the mass of the vehicle m stays constant
* Air resistance is negligible after reaching v0 because most of the atmosphere isbelow
